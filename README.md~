My humble attempt to provide all of the answers to the problems in the
masterpiece "The C Programming Language, Second Edition" by Brian W. Kernighan
and Dennis M. Ritchie.

Absolutely no guarantees are made for the correctness or completeness of these
solutions!

Also, this project is used to familiarize myself with git and github, working
on this project on different machines and using common commands to organize
my work.

My own personal cheat sheet:

 - git init         The first command used to initialize the project, executed
                    in the root working directory of the project
                    
 - git
